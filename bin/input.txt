Privacy: a Formal Definition

	Without privacy, ideas that are critical of those in power are filtered by those in power. This limits change, and revolutionary ideas. Privacy is a right of the people, to protect the rights of the people. Without privacy, governments would be allowed to suppress the ideas of it’s citizens. More importantly, the definition of privacy must not change. If privacy were no longer a right of the people, the world would be plunged into a group of militarized dictatorships. The people would not be able to stop this as they do not have the basic, ever so important right to privacy.
	Citizens must realize that not only is the right to privacy important, the definition behind it is just as important. By changing the way one thinks about privacy, a new structured check on governments is established. Without the definition as stated above, governments could adopt a definition that believes privacy is not a right of the people. This is a dangerous thought as if privacy is not a right, then those in power can restrict, and take that away. Therefore, the definition of privacy as stated above must be established and adopted worldwide.
	Privacy is a right. In modern first world countries, privacy is a staple of their doctrine. In the United States it is written directly into the constitution. The right of privacy, as well as the restriction of search and seizures allow citizens the right they are entitled to. The U.S is not the only country to support this definition. First world countries across the globe have adopted this definition in support of individual privacy away from the central government. A world in which the definition is supported allows for ideas to flourish that can not only help the citizens of that country, but worldwide. TOR (the onion router) is an internet application that hides your internet traffic. This program was created in the United States, in a country that has adopted this definition of privacy. However China believes that the definition is incorrect, and continues to spy on its citizens. TOR, made in the U.S, allows citizens in China to browse the web, and spread revolutionary ideas in private. Because the United States has adopted the definition, it has helped those in countries without.
	Not only is privacy a right, it protects the rights of the people. In countries that have not adopted this definition are currently in mass turmoil. The middle east is full of absolute dictatorships that disallow it’s citizens to have the privacy needed for a democracy. By not adopting this definition they restrict the growth of ideas in their country. Governments that care about the country they exist in understand that allowing the citizens to restrict the government, only helps the country grow. Moral also improves, as the citizens realize they control the government, instead of the government controlling them.
	It can be argued that privacy actually does more damage than good. Radicals and extremists use privacy as a shelter, therefore the definition allows for chaos in an otherwise structured world. However, the need for privacy, and the benefits, far outway any of the negatives. The United States of America would not exist had the founding fathers not had the privacy they needed from the british government. Revolutionary ideas that challenge the government and hold them accountable for wrong doings, would be suppressed, allowing for a tyranny instead of a democracy.
	Privacy is a simple check on those in power. Keeping sure that they do not overstep their bounds. As the definition states it is a right of the people, and makes sure to protect the rights that exist. Without the definition as is, we would be in a world of chaos.
